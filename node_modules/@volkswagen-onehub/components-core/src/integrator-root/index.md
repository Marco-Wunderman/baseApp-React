**Purpose** The integrator root is a styled component that can be used as a root
by the integrator to define base styles like the default font family.

**Multi-language support** To support languages with non-Latin alphabets,
the integrator root can be used to define the default font family as well as
font-specific css rules depending on the ``lang`` attribute.
