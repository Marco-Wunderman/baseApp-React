## Previous Button

This button is a special version of the CTA, emphasis primary or secondary,
without context change (i.e. the "Action Button"). It displays an arrow to
indicate the correct direction for the "previous" action - a left arrow on the
left side for text direction LTR, or a right arrow on the right side for text
direction RTL.

There is also a _Next Button_.
