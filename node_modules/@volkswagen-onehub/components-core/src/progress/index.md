## Rules

[[grid]]
| [[grid-column | 1 - 4 ]]
| | **Purpose**
|
| [[grid-column | 5 - 13 ]]
| |  The Spinner shows up whenever a task can't be fulfilled immediately. We use two different versions of spinners, one version that is used whenever the progress can be tracked (for example loading) and one version that pictures a background process without showing the current state of progress.

| [[grid-column | 1 - 4 ]]
| | **Behavior**
|
| [[grid-column | 5 - 13 ]]
| |  Whenever possible, the spinner should be completed with a status message showing if a process has been successful. If the process was not successful, a [notification](/doc/docs/documentation/70-core-patterns/notifications.html?core-patterns-enabled=true) would appear.
