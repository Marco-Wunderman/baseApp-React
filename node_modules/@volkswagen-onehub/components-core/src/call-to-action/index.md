## CTA rules

### emphasis: primary, with context change ("Primary button")

**Purpose** The primary button is used for the single most important action in a
view, meaning there is never two primary buttons in a single view. Buttons can
also be used to link to another page.

**Quantity** Max. 1 per viewport

**Color recipes** Background: `colorRecipe450`, text: `colorRecipe750`

**Width** In a breakpoint <`b560` or a container <`560px` the width can be
adjusted individually. The width can be wider than the default size.

### emphasis: secondary, with context change ("Secondary button")

**Purpose** The thin-framed secondary button is used for subordinate actions.
Buttons can also be used to link to another page.

**Quantity** Max. 3 per page

**Combination** Can be combined to a button group with a primary or secondary
button.

**Color recipes** `colorRecipe450`

**Width** In a breakpoint <`b560` or a container <`560px` the width can be
adjusted individually. The width can be wider than the default size.

### Button group rules

**Alignment** In a breakpoint <`b560` or a container <`560px` the buttons are
placed under each other. The primary button is placed on top.

**Width** In a breakpoint <`b560` or a container <`560px` all buttons of the
group use the same width, if the width was adjusted individually.

### emphasis primary or secondary, without context change ("Action Button")

**Purpose** The action button helps users to manage the complexity of a page
without being overwhelmed.

**Differentiation** The action button is used for functions that take place
within a page, e.g. for opening an information layer. It is not a
[link](/pattern/link/?core-components-enabled=true) and no
[call to action button](/pattern/button/?core-components-enabled=true).

**Quantity** No limit

**Combination** Can be comined with the different layer types.

**Color recipes** `colorRecipe450`

### emphasis: tertiary, with or without context change ("Link")

**Purpose** You can use the link to navigate the user through the page.

**Combination** Links can only be combined with links of the same size (e.g. in
a list).

**Design** Links are always bold and underlined.

**Differentiation** It is not an
[action button](/pattern/ActionButton?core-components-enabled=true&styleguide-components-enabled=true)
and no [call to action button](/pattern/button/?core-components-enabled=true).

**Color recipes** Basic usage: `colorRecipe400`, usage for notifications:
`colorRecipe750`
