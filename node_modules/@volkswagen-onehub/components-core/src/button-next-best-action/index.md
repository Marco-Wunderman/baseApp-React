## Setup

The NBAB can have different states depending on its context and functionality.

- **Default:** The NBAB is shown in a circular container.
- **Expanded:** The NBAB is shown with a complementing text next to its icon.
- **Multi-optional:** A single NBAB splits into multiple options on request.

## Usage

### When to use

Following the principles of linearity and focus, the NBAB (Next Best Action
Button) offers the single most relevant action related to the screen it appears.
The NBAB follows a user centric approach, which means it is not necessarily
carrying the primary call to action, which is defined by business goals. Of
course in some cases the NBAB can hold the main CTA – then the primary button
should be hidden to reduce redundancy and increase guidance. Each page should
define at least one default next best action. Modules or section can override
that for individual NBABs.

Use the NBAB in either of the following cases:

- **Page generic:** The NBABs action is relevant to a larger section of the page
  or throughout the whole page it appears.
- **Process specific:** The NBAB appears in a context that is representing a
  clear single task - such an entry form.

### When not to use

Don’t use the NBAB just to win real estate by hiding different actions under one
hood - “show me all actions” is not what it is supposed to be.

### When to use what?

Use **default** as the standard application on touch devices. The default NBAB
can temporarily expand to gain users attention or to provide further information
(such as a price next to a “buy” icon).

Use **expanded** as the standard application on desktop resolutions. However,
the NBAB can contract to default state while on scroll to provide a cleaner
layout with less reading-distraction.

Use **multiple** when you have to offer multiple functions for performing the
same task. For example a “help” could be established via chat, video-chat or
contact form. In this case, the main action “help” splits into.

### Example Usage

The action offered by the NBAB should always be a positive action (step
forward). The only exception is made when a multiple NBAB is displayed in open
state, showing a “X”-Icon to close the options.

## Dos and don’ts

- Since the NBAB substitutes a possible primary button, it can only be combined
  with secondary buttons but must not be used in combination with another
  primary button.
- The action is always illustrated by a clear icon, don't use text in the
  standard NBAB.
- “Close” isn’t a typical NBAB action since it is not positive.
