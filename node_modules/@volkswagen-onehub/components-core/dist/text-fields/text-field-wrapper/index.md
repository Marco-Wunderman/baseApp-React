# Text Field Wrapper

## Rules

**Purpose** Use as a wrapper to give any text field extra behaviour and styling.

**Behavior** Whenever you must ensure a clear formatting of the user input, use
success and error states to give feedback to the user. Also use the character
counter for further validation. Text label `colorRecipe450`, text input
`colorRecipe500`, line `colorRecipe150`.

**Combination** Use with any text field.

### Technical notes for the character counter

The usage of the character counter requires the assignment of `maxLength`.

_Count visible characters_: The Character counter shows the number of visible
characters, not the number of the transferred bytes for the value.

In case, the text-field receives complex unicode characters (e.g. emojis) as input
values, the number of counted characters might not match the visible number of
characters. This happens due to the fact, that some visible characters consist
of multiple unicode characters.
