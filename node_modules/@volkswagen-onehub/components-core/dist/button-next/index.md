## Next Button

This button is a special version of the CTA, emphasis primary or secondary,
without context change (i.e. the "Action Button"). It displays an arrow to
indicate the correct direction for the "next" action - a right arrow on the
right side for text direction LTR, or a left arrow on the left side for text
direction RTL.

There is also a _Previous Button_.
