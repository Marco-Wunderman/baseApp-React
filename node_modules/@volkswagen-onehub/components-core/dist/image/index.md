## Purpose

Base component for defining an image or a lazyloading image.

## Dos and don’ts

It is recommended to load the 3rd party lib "lazysizes" as early as possible,
therefore it might make sense to include this lib to an early loading script in
the consumer application of the d6-lsg. Futher information can be found
[here](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes#tip-wherehow-to-include-lazysizes).

## Text alternatives

To meet WCAG 2.0 guidelines every image you add to your site needs to have an
alt attribute.  
If the image is informational, set the alt equal to a descriptive alternative
for that image.  
If the image is decorative or redundant to adjacent text, use one of the two
variants `<DecorativeImage>` and `<DecorativeLazyImage>` that have alt=""
preset, which conveys to assistive technology users that the image isn’t
necessary for understanding the page.

## Usage examples

A responsive image with srcSet

```javascript
<Image
	src="https://image.sinnerschrader.io/1024x768/ccc/111/320x372.png"
	srcSet="https://image.sinnerschrader.io/1024x768/ccc/111/1440x768.png 1440w, https://image.sinnerschrader.io/1024x768/ccc/111/320x372.png 768w"
	sizes="(max-width: 768px) 320px, 1440px"
	alt="Short descriptive name"
/>
```
