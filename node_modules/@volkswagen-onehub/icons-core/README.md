# `@vwa/icons-core`

> This package contains a collection of icons to be used by D6 applications.
> These icons are distributed as react components.

## Setup

This project provides a build script to convert icons (SVGs) to React
components.

In the source folder there exists one folder for each icon, with up to three SVG
files and a JSON file. Each folder's name equals the name of the icon, e.g.
`myIcon`.

Icons should be available in up to three sizes, with a `default` size (24 x
24px), a `small` variant of (12 x 12px) and a `large` variant of (48 x 48px).

In order to create a single component `MyIcon` with these variants, place
correspondingly named SVG files into an icon's folder, e.g. `myIcon/small.svg`,
`myIcon/default.svg` and `myIcon/large.svg`.

You can add an `index.json` file with a description that provides additional
meta information:

```
{
	"description": "text"
}
```

Run `yarn build` to build all icon components included in the source folder.

## Usage

1. Import icons from `@volkswagen-onehub/icons-core`.
2. Use the icon like this: `<MyIcon variant={variantKey} />`.
